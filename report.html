                    <li>1. Client: Ashley (friend).</li>
                    <li>2. The header I made is probably my favorite part.</li>
                    <li>3. While my pages may not be strongly independent, I do have 5 (6 including this one).</li>
                    <li>4. I am also proud of my navigation links, even if my dropdown navbar didn't turn out exactly how I envisioned it.</li>
                    <li>5. Various media queries alter the layout depending on the width of the screen, tho separate css files are not used.</li>
                    <li>6. I have a very clear global style, tho it may be too clear. My pages have little individuality, and I did not create separate css files.</li>
                    <li>7. I have several images with alt attributes.</li>
                    <li>8. I have declared a favicon! Isn't is adorable?</li>
                    <li>9. I've done as you've asked, m'lohrdship.</li>
                    <li>10. Haven't the faintest clue.</li>
                    <li>11. *Bluff*</li>
                    <li>12. Sent in Slack DM and invited user "twodee" to repository.</li>
                    <li>13. Done.</li>
                    <li>14. And done.</li>
                    <li>15. Aaaaaand done.</li>
                    <li>16. My axes are defined for the most part, but there is some awkwardness with some widths with my media queries. I don't have a great sense for design.</li>
                    <li>17. I used bebas neue for my headers, but times new roman for my copy. It's not the best pairing, but it is... *one..., ... two* yea, two different fonts.</li>
                    <li>18. Menu Button checks this box, I believe.</li>
                    <li>19. Resources page contains three links to external websites that open in a separate tab.</li>
                    <li>20. It's readable, but far from perfect, conventional, or clean. Sorry.</li>
                    <li>21. My site has- read- TWO animations :)</li>
                </ol>

                    I'm overall pretty impressed with how the website turned out. I wasn't expecting a whole
                    lot, and I didn't give a lot of direction for anything specific. I really like how the
                    website looks overall. I feel like there is a lot of unused space, however, and there are
                    times where the page looks a little funky. I was also hoping for more quantity and focus
                    with the content itself, but I've been pretty busy myself, so I understand. I intended on
                    playing a more direct role, so I can't blame Marwan for not being able to write about my
                    interests as well. I think there's plenty of room for improvement, but as the client, I am
                    satisfied with how it turned out.
