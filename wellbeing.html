                <span>Affection</span> <br><br>
                Make sure your displays of affection for your child outnumber any consequences or
                punishments. Hugs, kisses and good-natured roughhousing reassure your child of your love.
                Praise and attention also can motivate your toddler to follow the rules, rather than
                overloading your child with rules from the outset — which might frustrate him or her.
                Prioritize those geared toward safety first and gradually add rules over time. Help your
                toddler follow the rules by childproofing your home and eliminating some temptations.

                <span>Discipline</span> <br><br>
                Despite your best efforts, your toddler will break the rules. Ignore minor displays of
                anger, such as crying — but if your child hits, kicks or screams for a prolonged period,
                remove him or her from the situation. To encourage your child to cooperate, consider using
                these methods: Natural consequences, let your child see the consequences of his or her
                actions — as long as they're not dangerous; Logical consequence, create a consequence for
                your child's actions - tell your child if he or she doesn't pick up his or her toys, you 
                will take the toys away for a day; Withholding privileges, if your child doesn't behave,
                respond by taking away something that your child values such as a favorite toy; and
                finally Timeouts, when your child acts out, get down to his or her level and calmly
                explain why the behavior is unacceptable, encourage a more appropriate activity, and if
                the poor behavior continues, guide your child to a designated timeout spot — ideally a
                quiet place with no distractions.
