                Feeding toddlers (ages 1 to 3) can often be challenging. That's because several
                developmental changes are happening at this time. These changes can make mealtime
                difficult. It's important for parents to provide structure and set limits for the toddler.
                Avoid battles over food and meals, but continue to provide regular meals and snacks. Be 
                flexible with food acceptance as toddlers are often reluctant to try new things. If your 
                toddler refuses a food, don't make a big deal out of it. Try again in a few days or weeks.
                Avoid sweets or desserts, in particular as a standalone reward. Ensure these confections are
                included along with healthier options. Also, bear in mind how easy the things you're giving
                your toddler are to eat. Try softer, moister foods, or variants of food you'd typically serve,
                to help them eat more and avoid choking. Lastly, remember to keep their diet balanced! Vegetables,
                fruit, grains, protein and dairy - do your best to ensure they recieve adequate amounts of each.

                Walking, playing, exploring your backyard, or using playground equipment at a local park 
                can be fun for the entire family. Also, these games provide fun and fitness for parents 
                and toddlers: Walk like a penguin, hop like a frog, or imitate other animals' movements;
                sit facing each other and hold hands; rock back and forth and sing the song "Row, row, 
                row your boat"; bend at the waist and touch the ground; and other similar games. Also,
                try listening to music and dancing together! The possibilities are endless â€” come up with
                your own active ideas or follow your child's lead. Also, limit the amount of time your 
                child spends watching TV (including DVDs and videos) or playing on a computer, tablet, 
                or smartphone.
